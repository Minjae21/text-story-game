    It has several jobs you can choose in the beginning.
    It continues with options you can choose.
    It has 3 different stages from easy to hard - each stage have different monsters with different golds, exp you can earn.
    In the game, you can kill monsters, earn golds and exp in order to level up.
    With the golds, you can buy items such as weapons and armors at the store in order to increase your Attack and Armor.
    If you die, the monster will take some of your exp and golds.
    At anytime you want to exit the game, press 4.
